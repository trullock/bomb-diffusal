# Maze module

## Instructions

When armed, the maze will show a number of dots.
Correlate these dots with the maze maps in the instructions to identify the correct map.

Once ready press any key once.

The defuser must navigate the dot from its starting position to the end position shown on the map without colliding with any walls or the outer boundaries. Beware, these walls are not shown on the bomb itself.
